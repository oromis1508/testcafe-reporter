Reporter in .html format, for seeing it, you don't need to start any server. Except reporting to file, test run info duplicates in console.

### concurrency
<p id="concurrency">
<b>WARN: next line is required, concurrency with the reporter doesn't work without it!</b>
<p>To run tests concurrently, need to run the command first: `npx acd-html-reporter` (after npm i, should be used with installed testcafe)</p>
</p>

### appendLogs
<p id="appendLogs">
With that tag report always will be generated to one file.<br>
Result files saved like `report_3.02_34138.json`, where 34138 - run id. Result will be formed as by <a href="#acd-html-combine">npx acd-html-combine</a> command (with combined json).

With definition <a href="#saveToFile">--reportFile</a> can be used to write results in one file with new name.
</p>

### acd-html-combine
<p id="acd-html-combine">
Command npx acd-html-combine can combine some .json result files to 1 report file.<br>
The command can be used in 2 ways, with a folder or with list of files delimited by ',':<br>
1. npx acd-html-combine test-results/report_1.02/report_1.02.json,test-results/report_1.11/report_1.11.json<br>
In that case report will be generated from the files in the list.<br>
2. npx acd-html-combine test-results<br>
In that case report will be generated from all .json files in the folder (except which are ended with -combined.json).

Result html file will be generated in <a href="#baseReportDir">base report folder</a> with report-combined.json file with all files data.

<b>If need to save combined report to a different path, use --dest (-dest) argument, e.g.:</b><br>
npx acd-html-combine test-results --dest 123.html<br>
npx acd-html-combine test-results -dest=path/to/123.html<br>
In that case report-combined.json will be in the same folder. 
</p>

### baseReportDir
<p id="baseReportDir">
The report generates in base folder: {project}/test-results/report_{current date} as report.html<br>
Also reporter generates json file with test run info, it places in: {report_directory}/report.json.
</p>

If you need to run some times a day, save report, because old version with same date will be rewrited.<br>
You can <a href="#saveToFile">save report to single file with a new name</a>.

For extended test run information you can use Logger, implemented in the reporter.<br>
Method Logger.warn automatically sets status of a test: 'broken'.
```
Logger.warn('Something is strange in this test, may be bug, that 2+2=5 isn't truth');
await t.expect(2 + 2).eql(5);
```

Methods Logger.cleanUp and Logger.preconditions can be used in test hooks (beforeTest, afterTest, etc). It's equivalent of Logger.step, but without step number.<br>
Logger.step can be used with some steps as number, e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4], it will be showed in the report as Step 1-4.
```
Logger.step(1, 'Click the link and do something');
Logger.step([2, 3, 4], 'Doing something else');
```

Logger.info used for adding some information of test actions.
```
Logger.step(1, 'Click the link and do something');
await t.click('link');
Logger.info('Check that page opened');
await t.expect...
```

## Install

```
npm install testcafe-reporter-acd-html-reporter
```

## Usage

When you run tests from the command line, specify the reporter name by using the `--reporter` option:

```
testcafe chrome 'path/to/test/file.js' --reporter acd-html-reporter
```

If you want to have screenshots in report, use `-s` option:

```
testcafe chrome 'path/to/test/file.js' --reporter acd-html-reporter -s takeOnFails=true
```

<p id="saveToFile">
If you want to save report as single file, use `--reportFile` argument. If you don't passed argument value, it saved to <a href="#baseReportDir">base report folder</a> as report.html and report.json:
</p>

you can add folder name to report (report will be saved as path/to/html/report.html and path/to/html/report.json):

```
testcafe chrome 'path/to/test/file.js' --reporter acd-html-reporter --reportFile path/to/html
```

or if the path ended with .html, report will be saved to it folder (path/to/my.html and path/to/report.json):

```
testcafe chrome 'path/to/test/file.js' --reporter acd-html-reporter --reportFile path/to/my.html
```

<p id="screenshots">
If you want to replace files of screenshots with base64 strings, use `--base64screens` argument (report file can have large size).
</p>
